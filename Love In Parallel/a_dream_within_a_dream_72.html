            You say "I do," and everything freezes.

The crowd, the music, even time itself stands still.

The scientist's voice echoes:
"Subject 042 has chosen full immersion. Proceeding with permanent reality lock."

Your vision blurs. The world dissolves into white light.

Then, you wake up in bed. Ethan/Emily is beside you, smiling. Everything feels… normal.

Except for one thing—you can’t remember how you got here.

And in the corner of your room, a monitor beeps, tracking your every move.
