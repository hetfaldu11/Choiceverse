        You say "I do," and everything freezes.
        <br><br>
        The crowd, the music, even time itself stands still.
        <br><br>
        The scientist's voice echoes:
        <br>
        "Subject 042 has chosen full immersion. Proceeding with permanent reality lock."
        <br><br>
        Your vision blurs. The world dissolves into white light.
        <br><br>
        Then, you wake up in bed. Ethan/Emily is beside you, smiling. Everything feels… normal.
        <br><br>
        Except for one thing—you can’t remember how you got here.
        <br><br>
        And in the corner of your room, a monitor beeps, tracking your every move.
