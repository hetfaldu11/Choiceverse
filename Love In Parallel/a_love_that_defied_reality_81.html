            You walk toward Alex.

The moment your hands touch, something clicks inside your mind. The flashes stop, the confusion fades, and the world feels stable.

For the first time, you feel whole. The experiment is over.

As you and Alex sit on a park bench, watching the sunset, you smile.

You don’t know how you got here, but you don’t care.

You chose love. And maybe, that’s all that matters.
