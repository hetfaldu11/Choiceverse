        You walk toward Alex.
        <br><br>
        The moment your hands touch, something clicks inside your mind.
        <br><br> 
        The flashes stop, the confusion fades, and the world feels stable.
        <br><br>
        For the first time, you feel whole. The experiment is over.
        <br><br>
        As you and Alex sit on a park bench, watching the sunset, you smile.
        <br><br>
        You don’t know how you got here, but you don’t care.
        <br><br>
        You chose love. And maybe, that’s all that matters.
    </h1>
