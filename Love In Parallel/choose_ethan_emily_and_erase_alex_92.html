            You turn to Ethan/Emily, the person you fell for despite the confusion. Maybe the circumstances of your meeting were unnatural, but your feelings were real.

“I choose you,” you say, gripping their hand.

A cold sensation sweeps over you, followed by warmth. The world corrects itself.

You are standing at the altar. The officiant smiles as Ethan/Emily squeezes your hand. “Are you ready?”

You nod, a small tear slipping down your cheek. You don’t know why you’re crying.

After the wedding, you come across an old journal with missing pages. A single note remains:
"Reality is a fragile thing. Choose wisely, but know that every choice leaves something behind."

You close the book, looking at the person beside you. You love them, but something feels… unfinished.

Ending Theme: A passionate love—but with echoes of a forgotten past.
