        You turn to Ethan/Emily, the person you fell for despite the confusion. 
        <br><br>
        Maybe the circumstances of your meeting were unnatural, but your feelings were real.
        <br><br>
        “I choose you,” you say, gripping their hand.
        <br><br>
        A cold sensation sweeps over you, followed by warmth. The world corrects itself.
        <br><br>
        You are standing at the altar. The officiant smiles as Ethan/Emily squeezes your hand.
        <br>
        “Are you ready?”
        <br><br>
        You nod, a small tear slipping down your cheek. You don’t know why you’re crying.
        <br><br>
        After the wedding, you come across an old journal with missing pages. 
        <br><br>
        A single note remains:
        <br>
        "Reality is a fragile thing. Choose wisely, but know that every choice leaves something behind."
        <br><br>
        You close the book, looking at the person beside you. You love them, but something feels… unfinished.
        <br><br>
        Ending Theme: A passionate love—but with echoes of a forgotten past.
