            You agree to the experiment. The society members place you in a futuristic-looking chamber, warning you:

"Merging timelines is unstable. There are no guarantees."

You close your eyes as the machine hums to life. Reality shatters around you—flashes of both lives rush through your mind:

Alex’s warm smile in the café.
Ethan/Emily holding your hand on your wedding day.
A voice whispering: "This was never meant to happen."
Then, suddenly—darkness.

When you wake up, you are in an unfamiliar city, your mind struggling to piece itself together. Two familiar figures stand in front of you:

Alex, looking relieved.
Ethan/Emily, eyes full of love.
But here’s the twist—they both remember everything.
