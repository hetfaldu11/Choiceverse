    <h2>
        You agree to the experiment. 
        <br><br>
        The society members place you in a futuristic-looking chamber, warning you:
        <br>
        "Merging timelines is unstable. There are no guarantees."
        <br><br>
        You close your eyes as the machine hums to life. Reality shatters around you—flashes of both lives rush through your mind:
        <br>
        Alex’s warm smile in the café.
        <br><br>
        Ethan/Emily holding your hand on your wedding day.
        <br><br>
        A voice whispering: "This was never meant to happen."
        <br><br>
        Then, suddenly—darkness.
        <br>
        When you wake up, you are in an unfamiliar city, your mind struggling to piece itself together. 
        <br><br>
        Two familiar figures stand in front of you:
        <br>
        Alex, looking relieved.
        <br><br>
        Ethan/Emily, eyes full of love.
        <br><br>
        But here’s the twist—they both remember everything.
