    <h2>
        You reach for Ethan/Emily, and they pull you into an embrace.
        <br><br>
        For a moment, everything feels right.
        <br><br>
        But then, a strange pulse runs through your body.
        <br><br>
        You stumble back as Ethan/Emily whispers:
        <br>
        "We weren’t supposed to exist in the same reality."
        <br><br>
        Their form flickers. Their voice distorts. The sky itself seems to glitch.
        <br><br>
        A sudden tear in reality opens up behind you. If you don’t let go, the entire world might collapse.
        <br><br>
        But you hold on anyway.
        <br><br>
        "I don’t care," you say. "I choose you."
        <br><br>
        The world goes dark.
        <br><br>
        When you open your eyes, you are lying in a quiet apartment, Ethan/Emily asleep beside you. 
        <br><br>
        The city outside is unfamiliar, but peaceful.
        <br><br>
        You don’t know which timeline you’re in anymore. Maybe it doesn’t matter.
        <br><br>
        Because in the end—you’re together.
