            You reach for Ethan/Emily, and they pull you into an embrace.

For a moment, everything feels right.

But then, a strange pulse runs through your body. You stumble back as Ethan/Emily whispers:

"We weren’t supposed to exist in the same reality."

Their form flickers. Their voice distorts. The sky itself seems to glitch.

A sudden tear in reality opens up behind you. If you don’t let go, the entire world might collapse.

But you hold on anyway.

"I don’t care," you say. "I choose you."

The world goes dark.

When you open your eyes, you are lying in a quiet apartment, Ethan/Emily asleep beside you. The city outside is unfamiliar, but peaceful.

You don’t know which timeline you’re in anymore. Maybe it doesn’t matter.

Because in the end—you’re together.
