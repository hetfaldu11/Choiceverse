            It’s your wedding day with Ethan/Emily. The venue is perfect, the guests are smiling, and everything feels straight out of a dream.

But something is off.

Just before you walk down the aisle, an anonymous note is slipped into your hands:

"Don't say 'I do.' If you do, you will never wake up."

Then, for just a moment, you see Ethan/Emily's face flicker—as if they’re not who they claim to be.
