        You choose to ignore the glitches and fully embrace your love with Alex.
        <br><br>
        Over time, the strange flashes of another reality fade away.
        <br><br>
        You live a peaceful life, but deep in the back of your mind, something whispers: This isn’t how it was meant to
        be.
        <br><br>
        One day, you look in the mirror and see yourself—but for just a second, your reflection is someone else. You
        <br><br>
        blink, and it’s gone.
        <br><br>
        Did you make the right choice?
