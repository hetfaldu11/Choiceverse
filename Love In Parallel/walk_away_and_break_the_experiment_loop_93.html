    <h2>
        You step back. Alex watches you with hopeful eyes, and Ethan/Emily silently pleads with you to stay. 
        <br><br>
        But deep down, you know this isn’t about choosing between them. 
        <br><br>
        It’s about choosing yourself.
        <br>
        “I’m sorry,” you say. “I can’t live a life that was designed for me.”
        <br><br>
        The world shakes. The walls flicker between realities. 
        <br><br>
        The scientist appears, frantic. “No! You must choose! That’s how the experiment works!”
        <br><br>
        But you don’t. Instead, you turn and run toward the EXIT door that appeared once before.
        <br><br>
        The moment you step through, everything vanishes.
        <br><br>
        You wake up in a small apartment in a city you don’t recognize. There’s no Alex. No Ethan/Emily. No experiment.
        <br><br>
        Just you.
        <br><br>
        A fresh start. A blank slate. A world where every choice is truly your own.
        <br><br>
        And for the first time, you feel free.
        <br><br>
        Ending Theme: True freedom leaving behind love, but gaining self-discovery.
