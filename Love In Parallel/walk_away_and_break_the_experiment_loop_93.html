            You step back. Alex watches you with hopeful eyes, and Ethan/Emily silently pleads with you to stay. But deep down, you know this isn’t about choosing between them. It’s about choosing yourself.

“I’m sorry,” you say. “I can’t live a life that was designed for me.”

The world shakes. The walls flicker between realities. The scientist appears, frantic. “No! You must choose! That’s how the experiment works!”

But you don’t. Instead, you turn and run toward the EXIT door that appeared once before.

The moment you step through, everything vanishes.

You wake up in a small apartment in a city you don’t recognize. There’s no Alex. No Ethan/Emily. No experiment. Just you.

A fresh start. A blank slate. A world where every choice is truly your own.

And for the first time, you feel free.

Ending Theme: True freedom—leaving behind love, but gaining self-discovery.
