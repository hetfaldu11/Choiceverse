    <h2>
        You take a deep breath and look at Alex. 
        <br><br>
        The memories of your childhood, the laughter, and the countless moments
        you’ve shared feel more real than anything else.
        <br><br>
        “I choose you,” you whisper.
        <br><br>
        A sudden wave of dizziness washes over you. The world flickers as a scientist-type figure appears for a moment,
        nodding.
        <br>
        “It is done.”
        <br><br>
        The next moment, you are back in Alex’s apartment. 
        <br>
        The air is warm, familiar. You check your phone—no messages,
        no mysterious fiancé, no experiments. It’s as if Ethan/Emily never existed.
        <br><br>
        And yet… deep inside, a void lingers. You should feel whole, but something is missing.
        <br><br>
        One night, while unpacking an old box, you find a wedding invitation with a blurred name. 
        <br><br>
        The date is for a wedding that never happened. Your heart clenches, but the memory is gone.
        <br><br>
        Ending Theme: A bittersweet love—happily together, but with an unshakable feeling of something lost.
