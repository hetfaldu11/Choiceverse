            You take a deep breath and look at Alex. The memories of your childhood, the laughter, and the countless moments you’ve shared feel more real than anything else.

“I choose you,” you whisper.

A sudden wave of dizziness washes over you. The world flickers as a scientist-type figure appears for a moment, nodding. “It is done.”

The next moment, you are back in Alex’s apartment. The air is warm, familiar. You check your phone—no messages, no mysterious fiancé, no experiments. It’s as if Ethan/Emily never existed.

And yet… deep inside, a void lingers. You should feel whole, but something is missing.

One night, while unpacking an old box, you find a wedding invitation with a blurred name. The date is for a wedding that never happened. Your heart clenches, but the memory is gone.

Ending Theme: A bittersweet love—happily together, but with an unshakable feeling of something lost.
