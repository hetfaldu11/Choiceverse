        You refuse to give up your knowledge.
        <br><br>
        Your mind transcends time itself.
        <br><br>
        But as you drift through existence, you realizeâ€¦
        <br><br>
        You can no longer interact with the physical world.
        <br><br>
        You are now a thought, a whisper in time.
        <br><br>
        ðŸ”¹ You know everything, but you can never act again.
