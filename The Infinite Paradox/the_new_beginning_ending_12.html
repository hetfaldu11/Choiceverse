        You refuse to accept the end.
        <br><br>
        You gather all the fractured realities and forge them into something new.
        <br><br>
        The old universe is gone.
        <br><br>
        But in its place, something entirely different is born.
        <br><br>
        ðŸ”¹ A new reality begins. Are you ready to shape it?
