        You successfully reset reality, but something feels off.
        <br><br>
        No one remembers you.
        <br><br>       
        All records of your existence are gone. Your home, your researchâ€”erased.
        <br><br>       
        As you look at your reflection, you notice it fading.
        <br><br>       
        You whisper your nameâ€¦ but it no longer exists.
        <br><br>
        ðŸ”¹ You saved the world, but at the cost of your own existence.
