            You find yourself in a high-security conference room, surrounded by shadowy figures.
One of them, an elderly scientist, speaks:
"Dr. Carter, you were never a researcher. You were our greatest experiment."
They reveal the truth:
Project Paradox wasn’t created to explore time—it was built to contain you.
You are the anomaly, a remnant of a failed timeline that should not exist.
