        You find yourself in a high-security conference room, surrounded by shadowy figures.
        <br><br>
        One of them, an elderly scientist, speaks:
        <br><br>
        "Dr. Carter, you were never a researcher. You were our greatest experiment."
        <br><br>
        They reveal the truth:
        <br>
        Project Paradox wasn’t created to explore time—it was built to contain you.
        <br><br>
        You are the anomaly, a remnant of a failed timeline that should not exist.
