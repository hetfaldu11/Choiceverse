            You agree to become the anchor of Project Paradox.
The organization gives you access to the core of reality’s fabric, where time loops and anomalies originate.
You see countless versions of yourself, each trying to escape.
With a deep breath, you seal the loop, ensuring stability—but at the cost of your own freedom.
You are now the guardian of the timeline, forever watching over a world that never knew you existed.
Final Title: The Warden of Time
