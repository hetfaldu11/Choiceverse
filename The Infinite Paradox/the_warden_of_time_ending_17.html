        You agree to become the anchor of Project Paradox.
        <br><br>
        The organization gives you access to the core of reality’s fabric, where time loops and anomalies originate.
        <br><br>
        You see countless versions of yourself, each trying to escape.
        <br><br>
        With a deep breath, you seal the loop, ensuring stability—but at the cost of your own freedom.
        <br><br>
        You are now the guardian of the timeline, forever watching over a world that never knew you existed.
        <br><br>
