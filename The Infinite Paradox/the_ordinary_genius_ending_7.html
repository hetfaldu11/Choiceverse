        The mysterious entity erases your extraordinary knowledge.
        <br><br>
        You wake up in a normal world, with no memories of Project Paradox.
        <br><br>
        You live an average life, unaware of what you once knew.
        <br><br>
        But sometimesâ€¦ in your dreams, you hear echoes of a greater truth.
        <br><br>
        ðŸ”¹ You are freeâ€¦ but are you truly happy?
    </h1>
