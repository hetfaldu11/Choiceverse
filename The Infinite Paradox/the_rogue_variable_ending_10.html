        You fight against fate, refusing to accept your role.
        <br><br>
        Reality collapses around you.
        <br><br>
        Suddenly, you wake upâ€¦
        <br><br>
        Back at the start of Project Paradox.
        <br><br>
        Was it all a dream?
        <br>
        Or are you trapped in a loop, forced to make the same choices forever?
        <br><br>
        ðŸ”¹ Did you escape, or are you back where you began?
    </h1>
