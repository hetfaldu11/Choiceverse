    <h1>
        You fight against fate, refusing to accept your role.
        Reality collapses around you.
        Suddenly, you wake upâ€¦
        Back at the start of Project Paradox.
        Was it all a dream?
        Or are you trapped in a loop, forced to make the same choices forever?

        ðŸ”¹ Did you escape, or are you back where you began?
    </h1>
