    <h1>
        You launch a final global broadcast, forcing the world to see the truth.
        <br><br>
        People begin to rememberâ€¦ but at a cost.
        <br><br>
        Reality itself rejects the truth, causing paradoxes to unravel everywhere.
        <br><br>
        The world collapses into multiple versions, and you are lost between them.
        <br><br>
        In the end, you become nothing more than a voice echoing across dimensions.
        <br><br>
        Final Title: The Vanishing Voice
