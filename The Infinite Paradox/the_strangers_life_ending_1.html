    <h1>
        You decide to embrace this new reality. 
        <br><br>
        Life is normal, but people treat you as a different personâ€”your history doesnâ€™t match theirs.
        <br><br>
        One day, while looking into a mirror, you see your old self staring back at you.
        <br><br>
        You blink, and the reflection vanishes.
        <br><br>
        The paradox hasnâ€™t left youâ€¦ itâ€™s watching.
        <br><br>
        ðŸ”¹ You live a new life, but are you truly free?
    </h1>
