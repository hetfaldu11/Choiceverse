            You decide to embrace this new reality. Life is normal, but people treat you as a different personâ€”your history doesnâ€™t match theirs.
One day, while looking into a mirror, you see your old self staring back at you.
You blink, and the reflection vanishes.
The paradox hasnâ€™t left youâ€¦ itâ€™s watching.

ðŸ”¹ You live a new life, but are you truly free?
