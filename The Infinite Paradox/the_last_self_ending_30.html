        You fight against the other versions of yourself, erasing them one by one.
        <br><br>
        At the end, you are the only one left.
        <br><br>
        But with all others erasedâ€¦ who is the real version?
        <br><br>
        Are you the original? Or just the last survivor of the paradox?
