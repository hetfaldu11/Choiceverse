        Story Concept:
        <br><br>
        You are Dr. Elias Carter,
        <br>
        a brilliant but reckless physicist who has been working on a classified government experiment known as Project Paradox.
        <br><br>
        It aims to unlock a new dimension of existence, where reality itself can be rewritten.
        <br><br>
        But during the final test, something goes wrong. The machine overloads, and you are pulled into a world where
        <br><br>
        time, space, and logic no longer follow the rules you know. 
        <br><br>
        Now, you must navigate through fractured realities, make choices that shape the fate of entire worlds, and uncover the true purpose behind Project Paradox.
        <br><br>
        Will you escape? Or will you become part of the paradox forever?
