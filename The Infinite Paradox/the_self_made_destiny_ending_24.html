        Using the machine, you reintegrate yourself into reality, rewriting your own history.
        <br><br>
        To the world, you were never missing—you had always been there.
        <br><br>
        But… something is wrong.
        <br><br>
        You notice subtle changes—the world is similar, but not the same.
        <br><br>
        You are now living in a reality that was never truly yours.
        <br><br>
