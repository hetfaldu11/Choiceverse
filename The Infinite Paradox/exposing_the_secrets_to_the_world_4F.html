        You gather the classified documents and prepare to release them.
        <br><br>
        But something goes wrong:
        <br>
        The files keep changing. Every time you look back, details are different.
        <br><br>
        You receive a call from yourself—but an older version.
        <br><br>
        "If you expose the truth, you will rewrite history itself. Do you understand what that means?"
        <br><br>
        As you press the button to leak the files, you notice:
        <br>
        You no longer recognize your reflection.
        <br><br>
        Your memories start shifting—as if they were being rewritten.
