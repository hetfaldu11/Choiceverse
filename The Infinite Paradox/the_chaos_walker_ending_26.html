        You reject the Anchor and embrace the chaos.
        <br><br>
        You learn to bend reality, jumping between timelines as you please.
        <br><br>
        Soon, you are no longer bound to a single existenceâ€”you are everywhere and nowhere.
        <br><br>
        You become a legend, a story whispered across time, but never proven real.
