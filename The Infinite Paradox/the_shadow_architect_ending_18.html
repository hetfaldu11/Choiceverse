            You overthrow the leaders of the secret organization and take control of Project Paradox.
Instead of stopping the cycle, you decide to reshape it—controlling who stays and who gets erased.
You become the mastermind, rewriting history as you see fit.
But as you rewrite others’ fates, you begin to lose track of who you were.
Are you still Dr. Carter, or just another anomaly in the system?
