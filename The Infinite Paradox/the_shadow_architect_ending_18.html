    <h1>
        You overthrow the leaders of the secret organization and take control of Project Paradox.
        <br><br>
        Instead of stopping the cycle, you decide to reshape it—controlling who stays and who gets erased.
        <br><br>
        You become the mastermind, rewriting history as you see fit.
        <br><br>
        But as you rewrite others’ fates, you begin to lose track of who you were.
        <br><br>
        Are you still Dr. Carter, or just another anomaly in the system?
        <br><br>
