            Searching for proof of your original self, you uncover a hidden message—a letter from you in another timeline.
It reads:
“If you are reading this, then you have already lost yourself. But there is still a way back.”
You reconstruct your past, piecing together lost fragments… but something feels off.
When you finally succeed, you realize the truth—the real you was erased long ago.
You are just another version trying to take their place.
