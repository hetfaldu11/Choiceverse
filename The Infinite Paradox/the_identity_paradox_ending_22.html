        Searching for proof of your original self, you uncover a hidden message—a letter from you in another timeline.
        <br><br>
        It reads:
        <br>
        “If you are reading this, then you have already lost yourself. But there is still a way back.”
        <br><br>
        You reconstruct your past, piecing together lost fragments… but something feels off.
        <br><br>
        When you finally succeed, you realize the truth—the real you was erased long ago.
        <br><br>
        You are just another version trying to take their place.
