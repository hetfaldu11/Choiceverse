    <h1>
        You overload the core machine, shattering the paradox.
        For the first time, you feel real freedom—no more loops, no more versions of yourself.
        But then… the universe around you begins to collapse.
        You succeeded in breaking the cycle, but without it, time itself is unraveling.
        You close your eyes as existence resets, unsure of whether you will ever wake up again.
        Final Title: The Final Break
