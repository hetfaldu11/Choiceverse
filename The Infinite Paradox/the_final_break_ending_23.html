    <h1>
        You overload the core machine, shattering the paradox.
        <br><br>
        For the first time, you feel real freedom—no more loops, no more versions of yourself.
        <br><br>
        But then… the universe around you begins to collapse.
        <br><br>
        You succeeded in breaking the cycle, but without it, time itself is unraveling.
        <br><br>
        You close your eyes as existence resets, unsure of whether you will ever wake up again.
        <br><br>
        Final Title: The Final Break
