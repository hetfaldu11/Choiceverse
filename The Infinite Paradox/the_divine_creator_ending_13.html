            With the power of the singularity, you craft a perfect world.
No suffering, no chaosâ€”just harmony.
But over time, you noticeâ€¦
Nothing changes.
Everything is perfect, but nothing grows, nothing evolves.
Your utopia is static, lifeless.

ðŸ”¹ Perfection is just another kind of prison.
