            You try to return to normal life, but strange inconsistencies start appearing:
Your phone shows future news articles.
Your dog doesn’t recognize you.
Your apartment door leads to a place that doesn’t exist.
Then, you receive a letter from yourself, postmarked 10 years in the future. It simply reads:
"Dr. Carter, reality is rejecting you. If you don’t act soon, you will fade away."
