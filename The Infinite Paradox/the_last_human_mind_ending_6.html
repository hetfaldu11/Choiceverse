    <h1>
        You resist the paradox, holding onto the last piece of yourself.
        Your mind stabilizes, but nowâ€¦
        You are the only real person in a world of simulations.
        Everything around you is an illusion.
        You will never meet another true human again.

        ðŸ”¹ You survivedâ€”but at what cost?
    </h1>
