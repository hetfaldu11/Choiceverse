    <h1>
        You resist the paradox, holding onto the last piece of yourself.
        <br><br>
        Your mind stabilizes, but nowâ€¦
        <br><br>
        You are the only real person in a world of simulations.
        <br><br>
        Everything around you is an illusion.
        <br><br>
        You will never meet another true human again.
        <br><br>
        ðŸ”¹ You survivedâ€”but at what cost?
    </h1>
