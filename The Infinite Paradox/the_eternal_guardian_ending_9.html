    <h1>
        You fuse with the paradox, becoming its guardian.
        <br><br>
        Now, you maintain balance across dimensions.
        <br><br>
        But the cost?
        <br><br>
        You forget your own past.
        <br><br>
        All that remains is your dutyâ€”to protect reality itself.
        <br><br>
        ðŸ”¹ You saved the multiverseâ€¦ but lost yourself in the process.
