    <h1>
        You surrender to the knowledge.
        Your mind expands beyond the universe.
        You see all of time at once.
        You become a cosmic observer, forever watching, never interfering.
        Eons passâ€¦ and something strange happens.
        You see another version of yourself, about to make the same choices you once did.

        ðŸ”¹ The cycle continuesâ€¦ Will they break it?
    </h1>
