            You break into the secret underground facility where Project Paradox was truly developed.
The deeper you go, the more you realize:
The project was never meant to explore dimensions—it was meant to contain something.
There are recorded experiments showing people vanishing into thin air, never returning.
Classified reports indicate a Subject Zero—and the name listed is yours.
A voice speaks from a hidden intercom:
"Dr. Carter, we were waiting for you. You are the final piece of the experiment."
