        You hold reality together, using your very existence to stabilize it.
        <br><br>
        You are now the Last Guardian of Time, watching over all realities.
        <br><br>
        But as you gaze across infinite universes, you see a disturbing truthâ€¦
        <br><br>
        Another version of you, making the same mistakes.
        <br><br>
        ðŸ”¹ You saved existenceâ€¦ but the paradox continues.
