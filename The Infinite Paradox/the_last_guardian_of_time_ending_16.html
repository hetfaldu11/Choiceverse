            You hold reality together, using your very existence to stabilize it.
You are now the Last Guardian of Time, watching over all realities.
But as you gaze across infinite universes, you see a disturbing truthâ€¦
Another version of you, making the same mistakes.

ðŸ”¹ You saved existenceâ€¦ but the paradox continues.
