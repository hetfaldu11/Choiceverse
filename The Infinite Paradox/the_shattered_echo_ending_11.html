    <h1>
        You let go, allowing the paradox to consume you.
        <br><br>
        You become a whisper in time, a faint presence in broken realities.
        <br><br>
        Sometimes, travelers hear your voice, warning themâ€¦
        <br><br>
        But no one ever remembers your name.
        <br><br>
        ðŸ”¹ You exist only as an echo of what once was.
