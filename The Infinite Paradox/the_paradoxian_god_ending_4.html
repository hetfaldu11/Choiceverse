    <h1>
        You accept your role in the paradox.
        You are no longer bound by time, space, or logic.
        You reshape worlds, create new timelines, and rewrite history as you see fit.
        But as centuries pass, you realize:
        Thereâ€™s no one left to challenge you.
        You are all-powerful, but completely alone.

        ðŸ”¹ You became a god, but lost all meaning.
