    <h1>
        You accept your role in the paradox.
        <br><br>
        You are no longer bound by time, space, or logic.
        <br><br>
        You reshape worlds, create new timelines, and rewrite history as you see fit.
        <br><br>
        But as centuries pass, you realize:
        <br>
        Thereâ€™s no one left to challenge you.
        <br><br>
        You are all-powerful, but completely alone.
        <br><br>
        ðŸ”¹ You became a god, but lost all meaning.
