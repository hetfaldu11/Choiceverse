    <h1>
        You erase everything, resetting the universe.
        <br><br>
        A new reality is born, fresh and untouched.
        <br><br>
        You watch as the first stars ignite, the first civilizations rise.
        <br><br>
        Then, you see something terrifyingâ€¦
        <br><br>
        A scientist in a lab, testing an experiment called Project Paradox.
        <br><br>
        The cycle is repeating.
        <br><br>
        ðŸ”¹ No matter what, it all begins again.
