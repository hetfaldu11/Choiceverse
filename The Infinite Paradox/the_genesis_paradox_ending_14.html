            You erase everything, resetting the universe.
A new reality is born, fresh and untouched.
You watch as the first stars ignite, the first civilizations rise.
Then, you see something terrifyingâ€¦
A scientist in a lab, testing an experiment called Project Paradox.
The cycle is repeating.

ðŸ”¹ No matter what, it all begins again.
