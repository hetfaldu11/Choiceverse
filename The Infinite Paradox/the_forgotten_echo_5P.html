        You let yourself fade away, accepting that you were never meant to exist.
        <br><br>
        The world continues on as if you were never there.
        <br><br>
        But in the final moments before you vanish, you hear a whisper:
        <br>
        "The cycle begins again."
        <br><br>
        The story resets to its starting pointâ€”another version of you will soon begin the same journey.
        <br><br>
        Final Ending: The Eternal Loop.
