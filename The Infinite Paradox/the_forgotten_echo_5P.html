            You let yourself fade away, accepting that you were never meant to exist.
The world continues on as if you were never there.
But in the final moments before you vanish, you hear a whisper:
"The cycle begins again."
The story resets to its starting pointâ€”another version of you will soon begin the same journey.
Final Ending: The Eternal Loop.
