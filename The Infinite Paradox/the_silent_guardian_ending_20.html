        You realize the truth must be hidden, even if it means living in secrecy.
        <br><br>
        Deleting all evidence, you become a silent protector, watching reality from the outside.
        <br><br>
        You are a ghost in the system, ensuring that no one else falls into the same fate.
        <br><br>

        <br><br>
        The cycle begins again—but this time, you are there to guide them.
