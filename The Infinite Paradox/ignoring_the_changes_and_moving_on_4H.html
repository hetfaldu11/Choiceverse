        You force yourself to ignore the oddities and try to live as if everything is normal.
        <br><br>
        But as the days pass, you begin to notice a terrifying pattern:
        <br>
        People forget you exist. Your own family doesn’t recognize you.
        <br><br>
        Your home, job, and belongings vanish—as if they were never real.
        <br><br>
        Eventually, you can’t even see your own reflection.
        <br><br>
        A final message appears on your phone, from an unknown sender:
        <br>
        "You are being erased. Turn back while you still can."
