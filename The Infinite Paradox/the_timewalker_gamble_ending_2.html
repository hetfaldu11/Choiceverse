        You find a way to undo the changes, but something goes wrong.
        <br><br>
        As you activate the device, your body starts splittingâ€”you are pulled into infinite timelines at once.
        <br><br>
        You become a Timewalker, existing in multiple realities at the same time, but never fully present in any.
        <br><br>

        <br><br>
