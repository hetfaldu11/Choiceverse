    <h1>
        At the black-market auction, you realize:
        <br><br>
        The vault’s data is being rewritten in real-time.
        <br><br>
        A new world map is being sold—one where nations, leaders, and history are reshaped.
        <br><br>
        Ending: You can buy, steal, or destroy the information.
