        Reviewing the security footage again, you notice exactly 13 minutes are missing from every camera feed.
        Your own memories from 2:13 AM to 2:26 AM are blank.
        What you uncover:
        A hidden time-reset failsafe erased those 13 minutes.
        The vault disappeared because it was never meant to exist in this timeline.
