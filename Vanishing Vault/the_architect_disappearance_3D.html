            You track down Victor Lang, the lead architect who designed the vault's quantum security.
His house is abandoned, but you find a hidden bunker containing:
Blueprints of the vault—marked with “Failsafe Active”
A message on a whiteboard: "The vault was never locked. It was never there."
What You Uncover:
Victor disappeared days before the vault did.
The failsafe mechanism wasn’t to protect the vault—it was designed to erase it completely under certain conditions.

            "If you’re hearing this, I’ve already been erased. But you can still save yourself."</h1>
