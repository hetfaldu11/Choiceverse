    <h2>
        You track down Victor Lang, the lead architect who designed the vault's quantum security.
        <br><br>
        His house is abandoned, but you find a hidden bunker containing:
        <br>
        Blueprints of the vault—marked with “Failsafe Active”
        <br><br>
        A message on a whiteboard: "The vault was never locked. It was never there."
        <br><br>
        What You Uncover:
        <br>
        Victor disappeared days before the vault did.
        <br><br>
        The failsafe mechanism wasn’t to protect the vault—it was designed to erase it completely under certain
        conditions.
    </h2>

    <h2>Twist:<br> 
        Victor’s voice log contains a chilling line:<br>
        "If you’re hearing this, I’ve already been erased. But you can still save yourself."
