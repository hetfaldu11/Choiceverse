            Alex Verner has an airtight alibi—but he’s lying about something.
            <br><br>

            A black-market auction for stolen data, including blueprints for erasing digital footprints permanently.
            <br><br>
            Verner had access to "Project Recall"—a classified system that can rewrite history.
