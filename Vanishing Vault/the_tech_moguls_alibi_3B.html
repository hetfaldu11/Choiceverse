        Alex Verner has an airtight alibi—but he’s lying about something.
        <br><br>
        Digging deeper, you uncover:
        <br>
        A black-market auction for stolen data, including blueprints for erasing digital footprints permanently.
        <br><br>
        Verner had access to "Project Recall"—a classified system that can rewrite history.
    </h1>
    <h1>Twist: You receive an anonymous message: 
        <br>
        "The vault was never missing. It was never there to begin with."</h1>
