        You turn to the man beside you.
        <br>
        “Hey… where’s this train going?”
        <br><br>
        He slowly turns his head. His lips move, but there’s no sound.
        <br>
        His eyes look empty—like glass marbles.
        <br>
        You lean closer.
        <br><br>
        Suddenly, he grabs your wrist. His grip is ice-cold.
