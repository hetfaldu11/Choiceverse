        The conductor tilts his head.
        <br><br>
        "Unfortunate," he says.
        <br><br>
        The train starts moving again.

        Your body feels… heavy. Cold.
        <br>
        Your reflection in the window changes—your eyes are now empty.
        <br><br>
        You will never leave.
        <br><br>
        GAME OVER.
