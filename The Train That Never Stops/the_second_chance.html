        You step off the train. The platform feels… real.
        <br>
        The air is warm. You see a city ahead, familiar yet distant.
        <br><br>
        The train behind you disappears.
        <br>
        You survived. You woke up.
        <br>
        But in the distance… a faint whistle echoes.
        <br>
        The train is coming back.
        <br><br>
        And someone else will have to make the same choice.
        <br><br>
        YOU ESCAPED.
