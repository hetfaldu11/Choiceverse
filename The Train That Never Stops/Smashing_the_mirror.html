            The moment the mirror shatters the train screeches to a halt.
            <br>
            The passengers vanish.
            <br><br>
            You wake up in a hospital bed, doctors hovering over you.
            <br>
            "They’re awake!" someone shouts.
            <br><br>
            You escaped the limbo.
            <br>
            But in the reflection of the hospital window…
            <br>
            The train is still there. Waiting.
            <br><br>
            YOU SURVIVED… FOR NOW.
