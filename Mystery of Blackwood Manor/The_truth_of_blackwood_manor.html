    <h3>
        You run your fingers over the strange markings on the tunnel walls.
        <br><br>
        They look ancient, but as you brush away the dust, you realize they are words… written in dried blood.
        <br><br>
        The message reads:
        <br>
        "The truth is buried beneath the house. Find the locket, break the curse."
        <br><br>
        Your heart pounds as you move deeper into the tunnel.
        <br>
        The air grows colder, and you notice bones scattered across the ground. 
        <br><br>
        Suddenly, you see a rusted metal door at the end of the passage.
        <br><br>
        As you push it open, you step into a hidden chamber.
        <br><br>
        The room is lined with portraits of the Blackwood family,their eyes seemingly following you. 
        <br><br>
        In the center of the chamber, lying on a stone pedestal, is a golden locket.
        <br><br>
        You pick it up, and suddenly, a ghostly figure appears—a man with hollow, sorrowful eyes.
        <br><br>
        He speaks in a whisper:
        <br>
        "I am Lord Blackwood… the one who built this cursed house. 
        <br><br>
        My greed and betrayal trapped my family here.
        <br>
        We cannot leave… unless the locket is destroyed.
        <br>
