            You run your fingers over the strange markings on the tunnel walls. They look ancient, but as you brush away the dust, you realize they are words… written in dried blood.
            <br>
The message reads:
"The truth is buried beneath the house. Find the locket, break the curse."
            <br>
Your heart pounds as you move deeper into the tunnel. The air grows colder, and you notice bones scattered across the ground. Suddenly, you see a rusted metal door at the end of the passage.
            <br>
As you push it open, you step into a hidden chamber. The room is lined with portraits of the Blackwood family, their eyes seemingly following you. In the center of the chamber, lying on a stone pedestal, is a golden locket.
            <br>
You pick it up, and suddenly, a ghostly figure appears—a man with hollow, sorrowful eyes. He speaks in a whisper:
            <br>
"I am Lord Blackwood… the one who built this cursed house. My greed and betrayal trapped my family here. We cannot leave… unless the locket is destroyed."
        <br>
        
        <br>
