    <h2>
        When you pick up the golden locket, the walls start bleeding, and a shadowy figure emerges from the portraits.
        <br><br>
        The ghost of Lord Blackwood laughs coldly:
        <br>
        "You fool… The locket was never the key to freedom. It was the key to your doom."
        <br><br>
        The locket burns your skin, and you realize it's bonding to you.
        <br><br>
        You try to drop it, but it won’t let go.
        <br><br>
        Your vision blurs, and suddenly you are standing inside one of the portraits, trapped forever.
        <br><br>
        (Ending: "The Mansion Claims Another Soul")
