    <h2>
        You smash the locket and break the curse. The mansion crumbles, and you barely escape.
        <br><br>
        But then you wake up… in your car… on the same dark road.
        <br><br>
        Your phone says the same date and time as when you first arrived.
        <br>
        The mansion is still standing in the distance.
        <br><br>
        The curse never ends—you are trapped in a time loop, forced to relive the nightmare over and over.
        <br><br>
        (Ending: "The Endless Nightmare")
