            You smash the locket and break the curse. The mansion crumbles, and you barely escape.
<br><br>
But then—

You wake up… in your car… on the same dark road.
<br><br>
Your phone says the same date and time as when you first arrived.
The mansion is still standing in the distance.
<br>
The curse never ends—you are trapped in a time loop, forced to relive the nightmare over and over.
<br><br>
(Ending: "The Endless Nightmare")
