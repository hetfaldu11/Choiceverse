        <h1>You pull back the large painting of the hollow-eyed man, revealing a small compartment hidden in the wall. Inside, you find a leather-bound diary, its pages old and fragile.
            <br><br>
            The diary belongs to Eleanor Blackwood, a woman who lived in the mansion over 100 years ago. As you flip through the pages, you find a terrifying entry:
            <br><br>
            "The clock strikes twelve, and the walls whisper. The spirits will not let me leave. The only way out is beneath the houseâ€¦ but the tunnel is cursed."
            <br><br>
            Suddenly, you hear footsteps approaching from the hallway!<br>
            
            <br>
