    <h2>
        You face your doppelganger, ready to fight.
        <br><br>
        The doppelganger mirrors your every move, anticipating your attacks.
        <br>
        You realize that you can't defeat them in a physical battle.
        <br><br>
        As you struggle, the doppelganger whispers: "You can't win. We are one."
        <br><br>
        In a moment of clarity, you remember the locket.
        <br>
        You reach for it, and the doppelganger recoils in fear.
        <br><br>
        With a final effort, you press the locket against their chest.
        <br>
        The doppelganger screams and vanishes in a puff of smoke.
        <br><br>
        You are left standing alone, victorious.
        <br>
        The curse is broken, and you are free.
        <br><br>
        (Ending: "The Curse is Lifted")
