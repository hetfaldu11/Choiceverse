    <h2>
        As you explore the tunnels, you start to notice something terrifying:
        <br>
        The walls are pulsing, as if they are breathing.
        <br><br>
        Doors that were open before are now sealed shut.
        <br><br>
        The paintings are changing, showing you in them—even though you’ve never been here before.
        <br><br>
        Then you hear the whisper:
        <br>
        "You are not a visitor. You are the next Blackwood."
        <br><br>
        The mansion is not haunted—it is alive, and it wants to make you its new master.
        <br><br>
        If you stay, you will inherit the curse and rule the ghosts.
        <br><br>
        (Ending: "The New Lord of Blackwood")
