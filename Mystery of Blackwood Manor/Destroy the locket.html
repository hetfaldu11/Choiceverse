    <h2>
        You smash the locket against the pedestal.
        <br><br>
        A blinding light fills the chamber as the spirits are freed from the curse.
        <br><br>
        The mansion begins to collapse, and you barely escape before it vanishes into nothing.
        <br><br>
        You wake up on the roadside, as if it was all a dreamâ€¦ 
        <br>
        but the Blackwood Manor is gone forever.
        <br><br>
        (Ending: "The Curse is Broken")
