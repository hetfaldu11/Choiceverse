    <h2>
        you choose to help the ghost bride, she promises to free you.
        <br>
        But once the curse is broken, she laughs and vanishes into the night, whispering:
        <br>
        "Thank you… but only one of us could be free."
        <br><br>
        The mansion vanishes, but you are still inside.
        You look at your hands and realize… you are now the ghost.
        <br><br>
        (Ending: "The New Haunting Begins")
